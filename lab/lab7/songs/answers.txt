For the first question, I would choose the attribute with the highest average value among the three. This attribute would represent the user's "audio aura."
For the second question, I would consider the average values of the three attributes for all users. By comparing the magnitude of each attribute for each user, I could categorize users into 8 classes. This approach would provide a more finely-grained representation of user preferences. Additionally, if there is reliable labeled data available, I might explore machine learning techniques or clustering methods to further classify users.
