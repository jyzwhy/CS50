Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The first several predictions.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000 in this condition. In more general cases, I believe that when I can consistently obtain the same ranking in each simulation, then the number of simulations I have conducted is sufficient.
